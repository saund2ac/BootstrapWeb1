    <div class="centered">THE FORESTS & MOUNTAINS</div>
  </div>

  <p>There is a tremendous variety of life in forests. Forests are important, yet they are being destroyed at alarming rates.
  </p>
  <p>A big region with trees is generally referred to as a forest. Boreal, tropical, and temperate forests are the three main types that exist. According to experts, these woods make up around one-third of the surface of the planet.
  </p>
  <p>Eastern North America and Eurasia are covered with temperate forests. Due to the four distinct seasons that exist at these latitudes, temperate forests have varying temperatures throughout the year. There is a lot of precipitation, which contributes to fertile soil that can support a wide variety of vegetation, including maple, oak, and birch trees. A few examples of the wildlife that make temperate forests home include deer, squirrels, and bears.
  </p>
  <p>Around the equator, regions like Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Central America frequently have tropical woods. 20 to 31°C (68 to 88°F) has been recorded as the typical temperature in tropical forests. The height of biodiversity can be found in tropical rainforests. The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja), an endangered huge predatory bird, is one of the creatures. It is becoming increasingly rare in Central and South America as a result of habitat degradation.
  </p>
  <p>Another endangered ape species is the bonobo (Pan paniscus), which lives in the tropical forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Africa. Its populations are declining as a result of deforestation and hunting for human consumption.
  </p>
  <p>The tropics and subtropics are home to tropical mangrove forests, which are characterized by trees and shrubs that thrive in brackish or salt water. The extremely endangered pygmy three-toed sloth lives on the Panamanian island of Escudo de Veragua in the red mangrove forest (Bradypus pygmaeus).
  </p>
    <p>The boreal forest, commonly referred to as taiga, is the third type of forest. Russia, Scandinavia, and North America are all home to boreal forests, one of the largest land biomes on the planet (Alaska and Canada). Carbon dioxide is significantly removed from the atmosphere by boreal woods. In boreal woodlands, the temperature is typically below zero. The majority of the needle-leaf plant species in boreal forests are conifers, including spruce, fir, and pine trees. Just a few examples of large herbivorous mammals in this area include moose and deer. In order to find milder weather during the chilly winters in the forest, the majority of taiga native birds migrate.
    </p>

                            <p>One of the wildlife species in the Amazon Rainforest that is threatened is the amazonian jaguar. The jaguar is the largest cat in South America, and there are currently a lot of them in the Amazon. It can reach a length of 2.5 meters, including the tail, and weigh up to 120 kg. He is a solitary animal, an excellent swimmer, and a night person.

                            <p>It is made up of a Brazilian endemic monkey species, weighing about 800 grams. The species' mane, which has a highly distinct orange tint, is the source of its common name. is on the list of species that are highly vulnerable to going extinct.
                            </p>
                            <p>It's interesting to note that this species' name was given when a specimen was presented to Madame de Pompadour in 1754; she dubbed him le petit singe-lion, which is French for "small golden lion."
                            </p>

                              <br>

                          <h3 id="tapir">The South American Tapir</h3>
                            <p>Together with jaguars and the huge otter, this cute mammal is one of the three large species that tourists aspire to encounter in the rainforest. Notwithstanding their hefty appearance, the hoofed mammals are very agile, and they eat clay licks that may be found in the jungle.
                            </p>
                            <p>It is currently believed that it is in risk of going extinct in Peru, but the threat is not much worse in the other regions where it is found. Loss of habitat caused by practices like logging and burning is one of its greatest dangers.
                            </p>
                            <p>Tapirs are also in danger as a result of illicit poaching and habitat loss brought on by human activity.

                            <p>Among the cutest animals in the Amazon Rainforest Wildlife, giant otters can grow up to 1.7 metres long and can be found in the waterways that run through the jungle. Thanks to its resistant whiskers and a sharp eye, it easily identifies the movements of prey in the water.
                            </p>
                            <p>The otters feeds on fish mostly, playing an important role as a predator in ecosystems.
                            </p>
                            <p>Indiscriminate hunting is its most representative threat, in addition to habitat destruction, water pollution and the action of fishing in the area. Peru protects the species in several national parks, such as the one in Manu National Park and in the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="pink-dolphin">Pink Amazon Dolphin</h3>
                            <p>The Inia geoffrensis, sometimes referred to as the boto or Amazon dolphin, is a species of dolphin. Although albinism is the most prevalent coloration, it can also have pink or pale blue coloring and inhabits the Amazon River region. It belongs to one of the five freshwater dolphin species that exist today.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Amazon pink dolphin is in risk of going extinct in Peru as well as the rest of the Amazon region. The construction of dams, canals, and the diversion of rivers' natural courses are their principal threats, as it is in the majority of cases with Peru's various creatures that are in danger of going extinct.
                            </p>
                          <br>

                            <h3 id="spider-monkey">Spider Monkey</h3>
                            <p>The yellow-bellied monkey, also known as Ateles belzebuth, may be found not just in Peru but also in other South American nations like Brazil and Venezuela. Fruits, insects, and roots make up its main diet.
                            </p>
                            <p>The largest primate species in the Americas, measuring between 42 and 66 cm long. Individuals of this species have tails that are 88 cm long and weigh up to 11 kg. Having very long limbs is one trait that contributes greatly to agility.
                            </p>
                            <p>The mining sector has taken over various places where its life develops, making human hunting and habitat damage its biggest dangers.</p>

                            <h3 id="panda">Giant Panda</h3>
                            <p>With its striking black and white coat, the panda is loved by people all over the world and revered as a national treasure in China. Given that it has served as our logo since the organization's establishment in 1961, this bear also holds great significance for WWF.
                            </p>
                            <p>Pandas are primarily found in temperate woods high in the southwest Chinese mountains, where they eat only bamboo. Depending on what portion of the bamboo they are consuming, they need to consume anything from 26 to 84 pounds of it each day. Their larger wrist bones, which serve as opposable thumbs, are used.
                            A panda's size at birth is roughly equal to that of a stick of butter, or about 1/900th the size of its mother. As adults, female pandas can weigh up to 200 pounds, while male pandas can weigh up to 300 pounds. Despite their size, these bears are skilled tree climbers.
                          </p>
                            <p>The habitat of the giant panda is one of the most biologically diverse in the temperate world and rivals that of tropical ecosystems, making it a prime example of an umbrella species that provides protection to numerous other species in its range. In other words, when we protect pandas, we invariably safeguard the nearby species of takin, crested ibis, golden monkey, and colorful pheasants. With ecotourism, pandas also benefit numerous local communities in a long-term economic way.
                            </p>
                            <p>The panda's major habitat is in China's Yangtze Basin. Panda populations are becoming more and more isolated and fragmented as a result of infrastructure development (such as dams, roads, and railroads), making it difficult for pandas to locate fresh bamboo forests and suitable mates.
                            </p>
                            <p>The pandas' access to the bamboo they require for survival is also diminished by forest destruction. More than 50 panda reserves have been established by the Chinese government, yet only 67% of the wild panda population really resides there, and only 54% of their habitat is protected.
                            </p>

                            <p>Snow leopards have adapted to survive in some of the most challenging environments on the planet. Their enormous black rosettes and thick white-gray coat fit in nicely with Asia's high, stony mountains. Snow leopards are frequently referred to as the "ghost of the mountains" because of their exceptional natural camouflage, which virtually makes them invisible in their surroundings.
                              </p>
                            <p>The snow leopard can easily climb very steep slopes thanks to its muscular physique. The snow leopard can leap six times as far as its body length thanks to its rear legs. Long tails let animals move quickly, balance themselves, and shield the snow leopard from the elements while it is resting.
                            </p>
                            <p>This beautiful cat ruled the mountains for millennia. The mountains were abundant with their prey, including ibex, marmots, pikas, hares, blue sheep, and Argali wild sheep. Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan are among the 12 Asian nations that make up the snow leopard's habitat range. Over 772,204 square miles are covered by the entire range, with 60% of the habitat being in China. However more than 70% of the habitat for snow leopards has not yet been studied. From 4.6 to 15.4 square miles in Nepal to over 193 square miles in Mongolia, home range sizes can vary greatly. In addition, depending on prey density and habitat quality, population density can range from 0.1 to 10 or more individuals per 38.6 square miles. Yet, it seems likely that the snow leopard population is dwindling.
                            </p>
                            <p>Being a top predator, snow leopards play a vital role in maintaining the health of their high-altitude habitat and are a growing indication of the effects of climate change on mountain habitats. Numerous other species and the planet's biggest freshwater reservoirs will flourish if snow leopards survive.

                            <p>Humans are the only known predator of snow leopards. The biggest threats to this big cat include poaching, habitat destruction, dwindling numbers of native prey species, and retaliatory killings brought on by conflicts between people and wildlife. The climate issue has a significant impact on snow leopard survival as well. The productivity of alpine habitats can be adversely impacted by rising global temperatures, which can then have an impact on the availability of prey and freshwater in the hard mountain environment.
