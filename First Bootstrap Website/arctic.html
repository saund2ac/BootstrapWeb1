        <p>The tundra biome is a chilly, frozen region for the most of the year. This biome has a brief growth season followed by harsh conditions, necessitating particular adaptations from the local plants and animals in order for them to survive. There are two separate cold, dry areas where tundra grow. Arctic tundra can be found in high-latitude locations, such as Antarctica, Canada, Russia, Greenland, Iceland, and Scandinavia, or on land masses above the Arctic Circle. Alpine tundra is found at very high altitudes on top of mountains, where the overnight low temperature is below zero.
        </p>
        <p>Tundra regions are also referred to as deserts since they typically receive less precipitation than 25 centimeters (10 inches) each year. They experience six to ten months of the year with average lows below freezing and lengthy, bitterly cold winters with strong winds. Only six to ten weeks each year, on average, have warm enough temperatures and long enough days for plant growth. The majority of the soil in the Arctic is permafrost, or soil that is permanently frozen; just a thin surface layer of thawed soil is present in the summer for plant roots to grow in. Many minerals required for plant growth are likewise in short supply in tundra soil.
          </p>
          <p>These circumstances cause the tundra biome, which is mostly treeless, to have one of its most distinctive characteristics. (The name "tundra" comes from the Finnish word tunturia, which means a hill that is bare or devoid of trees.) Instead, the tundra features sparse, low-growing flora made up of lichens, mosses, sedges, grasses, and small shrubs that are all better suited to surviving tundra conditions.
            </p>
            <p> Due to their adaptation to harsh environments, animals in the tundra make use of the brief growing season's transitory explosion of plant and insect life. Little mammals like Norway lemmings (Lemmus lemmus), arctic hares (Lepis arcticus), and arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) are found in the tundra, as well as large mammals like caribou (Rangifer tarandus). These animals accumulate fat reserves to keep them warm and insulated during the winter.Also, they have thick fur coats for additional insulation. Throughout the lengthy winter, some choose to hibernate in order to conserve energy. Throughout the winter, some people go to warmer climates. During the growing season, a large number of birds also move into the tundra to forage, mate, and build nests.
              </p>

          <p>Tundra carnivores including polar bears (Ursus maritimus), snowy owls (Bubo scandiaca), arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus), arctic wolves (Canis lupus), and arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) travel into the tundra during the summer when prey is abundant and their typical hunting grounds on sea ice shrink. In the winter, a lot of animals, both predators and prey, grow white fur or feathers to blend in with the ice and snow. Aedes nigripes mosquitos, for example, have a chemical component that functions as antifreeze, reducing the freezing temperature in their body fluids. Tundra insects have also evolved adaptations for the cold.
            </p>
          <p>Despite being far away, the tundra is becoming more and more endangered as people encroach upon it to construct structures or explore for oil, for example. But, climate change poses perhaps the biggest threat. Rising temperatures have the potential to destroy the freezing tundra ecosystem and its inhabitants, as well as thaw the permafrost beneath it, releasing greenhouse gases that would speed up global warming.
            </p>

                          <p>One of the most adorable creatures in the tundra is the Arctic Fox. Depending on the season, its coat can change from a thick white one to a short brown one. Due to excessive shooting in some places and the introduction of the giant red fox in others, the Arctic Fox's population has been falling. Overhunting has contributed to a declining Arctic fox population in places like Finland, Norway, and Sweden. The shrinking ice is mostly to blame for the appearance of red foxes in their range. Red foxes have occasionally engaged in food competition, and on occasion, they have been observed killing their rivals.

                          <p>Increased temperatures are making polar bears an increasingly vulnerable species. From birth to hunting, polar bears have typically adapted to using pack ice in their daily lives. Nevertheless, the ice packs are gradually melting away, making it difficult for these white fuzzy creatures to find seals, which are a vital source of food.

                          <p>Due to its declining population as a result of human intervention and DDT, the Arctic peregrine falcon was put on the endangered species list. Falcons typically consumed DDT anytime they consumed tainted prey, which caused their eggs to be delicate and frequently shatter during incubation. Because of this and the fact that they were also the target of human hunting, their population was drastically reduced, placing them on the endangered species list. Its number has been growing recently, though, after DDT was banned.

                          <p>These whales, like other marine creatures, are considered to be declining as a result of growing threats from overhunting and climate change. In their skin, Narwhals contain the essential vitamin C that people in the Arctic regions require, they are pursued. Some have also been hunted and killed for their ivory tusk.
                            </p>

                          <p>Due to rising activity for the extraction of fossil fuels in the Arctic region, these whales are more at risk of going extinct. A total of 321 beluga whales has been identified as of 2012. This is a sharp 75% decline from the population it had a few decades ago. As a result, it has been listed as an endangered species by the appropriate authorities.

                          <p>The Pacific walrus relies on pack ice for survival, just like the polar bear. This ice has been melting at a rate that is worrisome and a result of the changing environmental conditions. These pack ices serve as both a ground for gathering clams for nutrition and nurseries for their calves. The survival of walruses is gradually turning into a very critical matter due to the rapid disappearance of the polar ice caps.
