          <div class="centered">THE OCEANS</div>
        </div>

    <p>About 71 percent of the surface of the Earth is covered by the ocean, a vast body of saltwater. Oceanographers and nations around the world have traditionally classified the planet's ocean into four separate regions: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans. Oceanographers began designating the waters surrounding Antarctica as the Southern Ocean in the early 20th century, and National Geographic formally acknowledged this fifth ocean in 2021.
      </p>
      <p>The oceans contain a whopping 97 percent of the world's water. The weather, the temperature, and the availability of food for people and other animals are all significantly influenced by the ocean as a result. The ocean is still a mystery, in spite of its immense size and influence on every living thing on Earth. Humans have never charted, explored, or even seen more than 80% of the ocean. Compared to our own ocean floor, a much larger portion of the moon's and Mars' surfaces have been mapped and analyzed.
        </p>
      <p>Oceanographers have made some incredible discoveries previously, but there is still more to learn. For instance, we are aware that oceanic mountain ranges and deep valleys are similar to those seen on land. If Mount Everest, which is 8.84 kilometers (5.49 miles) tall, were placed in the Mariana or Philippine Trenches in the Pacific Ocean, two of the ocean's deepest regions, its peak would not even touch the surface of the sea. The Atlantic Ocean, on the other hand, is quite shallow because a substantial portion of its bottom is made up of continental shelves, which are portions of the continents that reach deep into the water. 3,720 meters is the average depth of the entire ocean (12,200 feet).
      </p>
      <p>The number of distinct species that live in the water is unknown. Some oceanographers think the number of species is decreasing as a result of the harm that pollution, rising sea temperatures, and other issues are causing to many marine ecosystems. Yet, oceanographers may be in for a lot more pleasant surprises in the years to come. Some scientists believe there are still between a few hundred thousand and a few million undiscovered species in the ocean, which means that more than 90% of the known species may still be undiscovered. There are currently about 226,000 ocean species known to science.
        </p>
      <p>Marcello Calisti, a National Geographic Explorer, has a love for learning more about the ocean's seabed and other ecosystems. Expert in biorobotics, he is creating an underwater exploration vehicle with "legged locomotion," which was modeled after how an octopus travels underwater. His long-term objective is to create robots that can investigate depths that are challenging for humans to access. Future oceanographers from all across the world will have lots to explore and learn because the ocean is so large.

      <h3 id= "Grey-Whale">The Grey Whale</h3>
        <p>The remarkable gray and white patterning on each individual gray whale gave the species its name. The majority of the lice and barnacles that make up their white patches are affixed to the whales' bodies. The weight of barnacles and whale lice that gray whales can carry is in excess of 400 pounds.
          </p>
        <p>The Eastern population, which can be found off the coasts of the United States and Canada, and the Western population, which can be found off the shores of Russia and Japan, are the two stocks of gray whales. The Chukchi and Bering Seas are where the Eastern stock of gray whales spends their summers when they are not migrating south to the waters of Baja California, Mexico, for the winter. Gray whales are a truly coastal species because they typically hang out near the continental shelf. Humans found gray whale mating sites in the late 1800s, which led to the mass extinction of the species. Gray whale hunting became unprofitable as a result of their dramatic population decline, and they gradually began to rebound.
        </p>
        <p>These whales can be identified by their moans, growls, knocks, and other characteristic vocalizations. They lack dorsal fins and have dorsal humps instead. One whale population (North Atlantic) is now extinct due to centuries of overfishing, and another is extremely threatened (Western North Pacific). With the help of fishing regulations, the third population in the Eastern North Pacific has thankfully recovered to the point where it was taken off the U.S. Endangered Species List in 1994. ​

    </p>
    <br>
      <h3 id="Vaquitas">Vaquitas</h3>
        <p>The vaquita is the smallest and most critically endangered cetacean in the world, and it is found in the waters off the coast of the Baja Peninsula in Mexico. After barely 50 years since its initial observation, the unusual creature is in danger of being extinct. The widespread use of gillnets for fishing, which results in population declines of up to 15% year, poses a threat to the vaquita. According to the WWF, there are just approximately 10 left in the world.
    </p>
      <p>The non-migratory vaquita has the smallest geographic range of any species of cetacean, inhabiting just 4000 square kilometers in the Mexican Gulf of California's Northwestern region. The Rocas Consag archipelago, which is home to an astonishing variety of marine animals, San Felipe in Baja California, and the Colorado River Delta are the main locations for the remaining individuals.
        </p>
        <p>Vaquitas often live in shallow seas within 25 kilometers of the coast, at depths between 10 and 30 meters. Their aquatic environment is turbulent, nutrient-rich, and active, with enough of prey to choose from. The vaquita is also particularly adapted to dwell in warm waters, enduring temperature changes between 14 to 36 degrees Celsius, whereas the majority of porpoise species reside in temperatures that are 20C or colder.
          </p>

          <br>

      <h3 id="Dugong">Dugong</h3>
        <p>These gentle giants are considered "vulnerable," and they are in danger from water pollution, coastal development, and loss of their natural habitat and food source (seagrass).
        </p>
        <p>The second-largest dugong population in the world, which lives throughout most of the southern coast of the Persian Gulf, is estimated to number between 5,800 and 7,300 individuals.
        </p>
        <p>In warm seas near the shore, dugongs are typically found in great numbers concentrated in broad, shallow protected bays. While all species of manatee use fresh water to some extent, the dugong is the only exclusively marine herbivorous animal. They can, however, endure the brackish waters prevalent in coastal wetlands, and a lot of them can be found in wide, shallow mangrove channels as well as on the leeward sides of substantial inshore islands, where seagrass beds are common.In areas where the continental shelf is still shallow, dugongs have been known to travel more than ten kilometers (six miles) from the shore, diving as deep as 37 meters (121 feet), where deepwater seagrasses like Halophila spinulosa are found. However, dugongs are typically found at a depth of about 10 meters (33 feet). Several activities make advantage of particular ecosystems. Predation danger is reduced when calves are born in shallow waters, according to observations. In the winter, deep seas can offer a thermal haven from the chilly waters nearer the shore.
        <p> Dugongs live a long time; the oldest specimen yet found was 73. The young are at risk from predators like crocodiles, killer whales, and sharks, and a dugong has also been reported to have perished from trauma after being impaled by a stingray barb. Nonetheless, they have few natural predators. Dugongs are susceptible to numerous parasite illnesses and infections. Helminths, cryptosporidium, several bacterial diseases, and additional parasites that haven't been identified are among the pathogens that have been discovered. In Queensland, illness is suspected to have caused 30% of dugong deaths since 1996. 
          </p>

  <br>

        <h3 id="manatee">Manatees</h3>
        <p> West Indian manatees were once common along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States, as well as in the Caribbean and as far south as Brazil's Atlantic coast. Manatees have, however, vanished from certain areas of their range as a result of poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation, and other factors. For instance, manatee hunting was widespread on Guadeloupe and other Lesser Antilles islands up until the early 1900s, which led to the extinction of the species. Manatees are now found in the southeast of the United States, eastern Mexico, Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panamá, Nicaragua, Colombia, Colombia, Venezuela, and the Bahamas.
        </p>
        <p>Throughout their habitat, manatees inhabit freshwater, brackish water, and marine systems in coastal and riverine locations. Suitable habitats include coastal regions with eelgrass and seagrass as well as other types of underwater vegetation. They forage near the edges of grass beds that have access to deep water channels, but when threatened, they run away. Over the most of the year, Florida is home to Florida manatees. They cannot, however, endure low temperatures below 68 degrees Fahrenheit for long periods of time, which keeps the population confined to peninsular Florida during the winter. The warm water from natural springs and power plant outfalls is essential to many manatees.
        </p>
        <p> Manatees extend their range throughout the summer and are occasionally spotted as far north as Massachusetts on the Atlantic coast and as far west as Texas on the Gulf coast. Manatees prefer to migrate along shorelines and waterways, and they can cover hundreds of miles in a single year.
          </p>
        <p>Manatees are under danger from toxic algae brought on by human pollution, habitat loss, and boat crashes. At least 13,000 manatees are thought to now inhabit their territory, with more than 6,500 of them living in the southeast United States and Puerto Rico.
        </p>
        <br>


        <h3 id="Monk-Seal">Hawaiian Monk Seal</h3>
        <p>One of the world's most endangered seal species is the Hawaiian monk seal. While current numbers are rising, they are still still approximately one-third of historic population levels after six decades of general population decline. The present rising trend is, however, in part because of NOAA Fisheries recovery efforts, which is significant. Hawaiian monk seals are only occasionally seen at Johnston Atoll, which is located roughly 1,000 miles southwest of Hawai'i and comprises both the main and Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. These monk seals are unique to these islands and can only be found there. The Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and State of Hawaii law all provide protection for Hawaiian monk seals.
        </p>
        <p>The Mediterranean monk seal and this critically endangered marine mammal are the only two species of this family still living, as the third species, the Caribbean monk seal, has already become extinct.
        </p>
        <p>Threats to these seals include commercial hunting for meat, oil, and skin, attacks from predators like tiger sharks, entanglement in fishing nets, and marine debris. There are only about 1,400 Hawaiian Monk Seals left in the world, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
          </p>
      </div>
      <br>

        <h3 id="dolphin">Hector's Dolphins</h3>
        <p>Hector's Dolphins are the smallest dolphins in the world, and they may be found off the coast of New Zealand. The world's rarest dolphins have stocky bodies, black patterns on the face, and a white throat and belly. They are mostly found in the South Island region.
        </p>
        <p> Only the South Island of New Zealand has the Hector's dolphins, and Akaroa Harbour and Banks Peninsula have the greatest concentration of them in a single area. They never stray far from their birthplace within their 52-kilometer territorial range. The North Island is also home to a subspecies of Hector's dolphin known as the Maui dolphin.
        </p>
        <p>The rounded, black dorsal fin of the Hector's dolphin, which resembles a Mickey Mouse ear, sets it apart from other dolphins. They have prominent black and white markings on their grey bodies. Moreover, they have a short snout. Mature Hector's dolphins weigh between 40 and 60 kg and can grow to a maximum length of 1.4 m, with males being a little bit smaller and lighter than females. At birth, Hector's dolphin calves are roughly 60–80 cm in length, weigh 8–10 kg, and resemble a rugby ball with flippers.
        </p>
        <p>Regrettably, trawl and gillnet fishing have significantly reduced their population. About 10,000 Hector's Dolphins are still living. With only an estimated 55 individuals alive, the Maui Dolphin subspecies of Hector's Dolphin is highly endangered.
        </p>
        <br>


        <h3 id="porpoise">Finless Porpoise</h3>
        <p> The Yangtze River and other lakes and rivers in Southeast and Eastern Asia are home to this marine species that is seriously endangered. Illegal fishing and habitat destruction put them in danger. The most recent census reveals that the finless porpoise population, which had been rapidly declining for years, has recently decreased very slightly to 1,012 individuals from 1,040 in 2012.
        </p>
        <p>One of the extremely few porpoises (relatives of dolphins and whales) that dwell in fresh water is the finless porpoise of the Yangtze river. It is adored in China and elsewhere due to its diminutive stature and endearing "smile." Yet we must stop it from following in the footsteps of the Baiji, a functionally extinct dolphin that lived in the Yangtze River.
        </p>
        <p> Porpoises are crucial to the sustainability of their surroundings. They devour fish and other river animals because they would otherwise multiply and tip the local food chain out of balance. Porpoises are also a strong indicator of the condition of their habitat because they struggle to survive in overfished or polluted rivers. By preserving healthy rivers and lakes, which many people significantly rely on for food, clean water, and a means of subsistence, we are also helping to conserve these porpoises.
        </p>
        <br>


        <h3 id="Hawksbill">Hawksbill Turtle</h3>
        <p>The word "hawksbill" refers to a bird's short, pointed beak. On their shells, they have a peculiar pattern of interlocking scales that give the edges a serrated appearance. Because to their unique colors and patterns, their shells are quite precious and frequently referred to as "tortoiseshell" in marketplaces. Hawksbills are primarily found in coral reefs in the tropical oceans of the world. They consume sea anemones and jellyfish in addition to sponges, which they extricate from reef crevices with the help of their narrow, pointed beaks. The only surviving members of a group of reptiles that have roamed our oceans for the past 100 million years are sea turtles. They are an essential component of marine ecosystems and support the survival of sea grass meadows and coral reefs.
        </p>
        <p> The Hawksbill Turtle's population is thought to have decreased by 80% over the past century. It is found in the tropical parts of all of the world's oceans, gulfs, and seas, mostly in coral reefs. Although it is forbidden to harvest turtle eggs, their colorful shells and eggs are highly trafficked. The destruction of the coral reef species they depend on is another hazard to them.
        </p>
      <br>

        <h3 id="GreenTurtle">Green Sea Turtle</h3>
        <p>The second-largest of the seven sea turtle species, the green sea turtle is very widespread geographically, breeding in over 80 nations and living in temperate and tropical coastal waters in about 140 nations. The amazing green turtle, which is very migratory by nature, makes difficult voyages through climatically diverse habitats in order to reach ideal foraging and nesting areas. Contrary to popular belief, the green turtle's name was not derived from the color of its shell but from the color of its cartilage and fat, which obtains its distinctively greenish tint from the species' strict herbivorous diet.
          </p>
        <p> The carapace (the top shell) and plastron, which together make up the turtle's shell, are formed of bone and cartilage (the underbelly). A stiff skeletal box is created by the side joining of the plastron and carapace. Green sea turtles have an oval carapace that lacks ridges and is made up of four lateral and five central scutes (scales), all of which are non-overlapping. Scutes are keratin-based and grow and shed as the turtle ages. The head and limbs of sea turtles are not retractable, in contrast to freshwater turtles. The combination of this adaptation and the animal's distinctively streamlined shell gives them exceptional hydrodynamic properties in saline water conditions. Its back flippers function as rudders to help them steer while their huge front flippers operate as paddles to help them move through the water at speeds between 10 and 35 kph.
          </p>
        <p>Threats like habitat loss, climate change, pollution, commercial fishing, and the illicit wildlife trafficking continue to contribute to the decimation of the species, despite the deployment of several safeguards meant to protect green sea turtle populations around the world.
        </p>
        <p>The green sea turtle, one of the biggest sea turtles, lives in tropical and subtropical waters and is an omnivore. The erosion of beaches, irresponsible fishing, and wildlife trafficking are all threats to them. This list of marine species that are in risk of extinction should act as a wake-up call that species all around the world are being wiped out by human activity. Governments must step in right away to tighten fishing regulations and create more marine protected zones.
