        </div>

        <p>Deserts are incredibly dry places where well-adapted plants and animals can be found. Deserts can be divided into four basic categories: hot and dry, semi-arid, coastal, and cold.
          </p>

        <p>The desert biome makes up around one fifth of the surface of the planet. Depending on the kind of desert, the soil in this biome might be stony, gravelly, or sandy. The annual rainfall in deserts is typically no more than 50 centimeters (20 inches), and the species that dwell there have evolved to survive in this exceedingly dry environment. Desert plants have water-saving adaptations. For instance, cacti have larger stems that retain water and are covered with spines to deter thirsty animals from consuming these water reserves. Some animals, like the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), have evolved to survive in the desert as well. Its extra-long ears aid in dissipating body heat into the surrounding air.
        </p>
        <p>Hot and dry deserts, semiarid deserts, coastal deserts, and cold deserts are the four basic types of deserts. Arid deserts, usually referred to as hot and dry deserts, have year-round warm temperatures. Famous arid deserts include the Mojave Desert in the southwest of the United States and the Sahara Desert, which covers a large portion of the African continent. Compared to scorching, dry deserts, semi-arid deserts are a little bit cooler. In semi-arid deserts, the long, dry summers are followed by wet winters. Asia, Greenland, Europe, and North America all have semi-arid deserts. Deserts around the coast have a little bit more humidity than other desert kinds. Although there are often thick fogs along the coast, it rarely rains.A coastal desert is something like Chile's Atacama Desert in South America. In contrast to other desert varieties, cold deserts are still dry but have very low temperatures. A desert that is extremely cold is the Antarctic.

      <h3 id= "cheetah">Saharan Cheetah</h3>
        <p>Less than 250 Saharan cheetahs remain, a critically endangered species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as a result of habitat degradation brought on by humans, being hunted by an expanding local population, and a decline in prey like sheep and gazelles. The Saharan cheetah is most frequently seen in rocky hilly areas, along with the adjacent dry riverbeds and drainage systems. Its coats are shorter and lighter than those of its African cousins. Because of the tremendous habitat degradation, the cheetah can only go over around 10% of its former territory. Little populations that are still present can only be found in Algeria, Niger, and scattered areas throughout the Sahara and the Sahel, from Mali in the west to the Central African Republic in the east.
          </p>

      <h3 id="gazelle">Dama Gazelle</h3>
        <p>The dama gazelle, which is mostly found in Chad and Sudan, once lived in large numbers and was extensively distributed over the arid (areas with little to no rain) parts of the Sahara desert. Now, it occupies only approximately 1% of its former habitat. It is a critically endangered species since there are just less than 400 individuals left in the wild. The numerous conflicts that have occurred throughout its range, desertification, overhunting, competition with humans and cattle, as well as habitat degradation and devastation, are all blamed for the species' significant population reduction. The Sahara Desert's endangered gazelle is particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation because it must travel great distances to locate enough plants and grasses to eat.
        </p>

          <br>

      <h3 id="ostrich">North African Ostrich</h3>
        <p>The North African Ostrich was widespread throughout 18 nations and the Sahara Desert only a century ago. The largest bird on Earth is now only found in four nations (Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, and Senegal), with a few small populations still existing in the area. It has lost 99.8% of its historical range. The North African ostrich population has drastically decreased over the past 50 years as a result of habitat degradation, desertification, cattle grazing, and hunting for the bird's food, eggs, and feathers. After the species was included to the IUCN Red List, numerous conservation initiatives have been launched to support its recovery. These initiatives range from increasing the number of ostriches in Senegal and restoring their habitat to bettering livestock management and fencing. â€‹

        <h3 id="vole">Amargosa Voles</h3>
        <p> This mouse-like desert mammal lives in the rare wetland marshes of the Mojave Desert in the US, which spreads from southeastern California, Nevada, Arizona and portions of Utah. According to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, no more than one square kilometer (247 acres) of uneven habitat for this species remains, making this species extremely vulnerable to extinction, particularly as habitat loss and fragmentation persist. After the US Fish and Wildfires Service listed the species as endangered, the animal has been placed in a captive breeding programme. The vole population is estimated to be made up of 67 individuals based on the most recent sampling efforts.
        </p>

        <br>


        <h3 id="tortoise">Egyptian Tortoise</h3>
        <p>Due to habitat degradation from agriculture and growing tourism, greater competition for vegetation, and illicit pet trade, this IUCN-listed critically endangered species in the Sahara Desert is all but extinct in its native habitat. The tiniest species of tortoises, which are just 10 cm long when fully grown, are now only found in Libya's dry, rocky deserts and coastal salt marshes, which are located between the northern boundary of the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean shore. The species continues to be extremely vulnerable and threatened because they are not legally protected in Libya. Although there are some captive breeding programs, attempts to reintroduce Egyptian tortoises into the wild have had difficulty boosting population sizes.
          </p>
      <br>

        <h3 id="sheep">Peninsular Bighorn Sheep</h3>
        <p>The peninsular bighorn sheep, easily recognized by their strikingly huge horns that circle their ears on the sides of their head, have historically been known to graze in the desert areas of North America. Its number was allegedly as high as 2 million at the turn of the 20th century. The population of the species was just 400 in 2000 due to ongoing human activity, which included habitat destruction, urban construction and development, as well as other issues like livestock grazing, disease, and predation. The bighorn sheep has been designated as an endangered species since 1988, and conservation initiatives are ongoing to safeguard its vital habitats and reduce the frequency of wildlife-vehicle incidents.
